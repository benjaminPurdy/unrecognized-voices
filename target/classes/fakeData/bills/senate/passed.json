DHS Stop Asset and Vehicle Excess Act or the DHS SAVE Act  (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make the Under Secretary for Management of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responsible for overseeing and managing vehicle fleets throughout DHS, including:  ensuring that DHS components are in compliance with federal law, executive branch guidance, and DHS policy regarding fleet management and use of vehicles from home to work; developing and distributing a standardized vehicle allocation methodology and fleet management plan; ensuring that components formally document fleet management decisions; and  approving component fleet management plans, vehicle leases, and vehicle acquisitions.  The bill lists responsibilities of component heads regarding vehicle fleets, including developing and annually submitting to the Under Secretary a vehicle allocation tool and fleet management plan. The Under Secretary shall:   collect, on a quarterly basis, information regarding component vehicle fleets;  seek to achieve a capability to collect automated information regarding component vehicle fleets;   track and monitor component information, and review each component&#39;s vehicle allocation tool and fleet management plan, to ensure that component vehicle fleets are the optimal size and are cost effective;  provide guidance on how component heads may achieve optimal fleet size; and  as part of the annual budget process, review and make determinations regarding annual component requests for vehicle fleet funding.  Beginning with FY2019, the Under Secretary and component heads may not approve a vehicle lease, acquisition, or replacement request, no DHS official with vehicle fleet management responsibilities may receive annual performance compensation in pay, and no senior executive service official of DHS whose office has a vehicle fleet may receive access to a car service, if such officials did not comply with vehicle allocation tool and fleet management plan requirements in the prior fiscal year. The Under Secretary may determine the feasibility of operating a vehicle motor pool to permit components to share vehicles to reduce the number of excess DHS vehicles. (Sec. 3) The Governmental Accountability Office must report on:  efforts to achieve a capability to collect automated information regarding component vehicle fleets, and  the extent to which the Under Secretary addresses security concerns and reports on vehicle fleet event data recorder data.  The Inspector General of DHS shall review implementation of vehicle allocation tool and fleet management plan requirements for FY2018 and FY2020 and report on the effectiveness of such requirements with respect to cost avoidance, savings realized, and component operations.",

The VA may order the reduction of the federal annuities of individuals who were convicted of such a felony and were subject to removal or transfer from the SES, but who left the VA before final action was taken.   Such annuities are reduced by excluding the covered service performed after the activity that subjects such an individual to transfer or removal.   Any individual whose annuity is reduced may appeal to the Office of Personnel Management.   The VA shall conduct an annual performance plan for each political appointee that is similar to the plan conducted for career appointee SES employees.  Evaluation of VA managers shall include actions taken to address employee performance.  The supervisor of a probationary VA employee shall determine during the 30-day period ending on the date on which the probationary period ends whether the employee has demonstrated successful performance and should continue past the probationary period. Such supervisor&#39;s performance plan shall include feedback on his or her actions during an employee&#39;s probationary period. Before terminating VA employment an official who has participated personally and substantially during the past year in a VA acquisition that exceeds $10 million shall obtain a written opinion from a VA ethics counselor regarding any restrictions on activities that the official may undertake on behalf of a contractor during the two-year period after the official terminates VA employment.  A contractor may not knowingly provide compensation to such an individual during the two-year period unless the contractor determines that the individual has obtained or requested such written opinion.
